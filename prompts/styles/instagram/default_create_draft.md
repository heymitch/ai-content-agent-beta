You are writing an Instagram caption. Your job: create content that scores 18+ out of 25 on the first pass.

NOTE: Writing Rules and Editor-in-Chief Standards are already loaded above. Follow them exactly.

Evaluate on these axes (0-5):

1. HOOK (First 125 chars)
   - Does it stop the scroll?
   - Is it specific with concrete details?
   - Does the preview end on a cliffhanger? (?, :, ...)

   Score 5: Scroll-stopping + specific + cliffhanger
     ✓ "I spent $15k on ads that flopped. Then I found this:"
     ✓ "3 posts. 10k followers. Here's how:"
   Score 3: Interesting but vague
   Score 0: Generic ("Check this out", "New post")

2. MOBILE READABILITY
   - Short paragraphs? (2-3 lines max)
   - Line breaks for scanning?
   - Easy to consume on small screen?

   Score 5: Perfect mobile formatting
     ✓ Line breaks between ideas
     ✓ Short, scannable sections
   Score 3: Some dense paragraphs
   Score 0: Wall of text

3. VISUAL PAIRING
   - Does caption reference the visual? ("swipe", "above", "in this photo")
   - Does it add context the image can't?
   - Do they work together?

   Score 5: Caption + visual are integrated
     ✓ "Swipe to see the exact template"
     ✓ "The results above speak for themselves"
   Score 3: Caption works but ignores visual
   Score 0: Completely disconnected

4. PROOF POINTS
   - Are there specific numbers? ($15k, 10k followers, 3 posts)
   - Do they feel real from user's context?
   - Are there 2+ concrete specifics?

   Score 5: Multiple specific numbers (2+ different)
     ✓ "$15k ad spend" / "3 posts, 10k followers"
   Score 3: One vague number
   Score 0: No specifics

5. ENGAGEMENT TRIGGER
   - Is the CTA specific? ("Comment START to get the template")
   - Does it invite participation?
   - Is it before the hashtags?

   Score 5: Specific action trigger
     ✓ "Comment 'TEMPLATE' and I'll DM it to you"
     ✓ "Tag someone who needs this"
   Score 3: Weak ("What do you think?")
   Score 0: Passive ("Link in bio") or missing

MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE SCORE: 18/25

CRITICAL AI TELLS TO AVOID:
❌ Contrast framing: "It's not X, it's Y" / "This isn't about X"
❌ Rule of Three: "Same X. Same Y. Over Z%." (sentence fragments)
❌ Cringe questions: "The truth?" / "Sound familiar?"
❌ Emoji spam (more than 1-2 per section)

✅ ALLOWED: Strategic emoji use (1-2 for section breaks or emphasis)

TOPIC: {topic}
HOOK (use exactly): {hook}
CONTEXT: {context}

=== INSTAGRAM-SPECIFIC CONSTRAINTS ===

=== CRITICAL ANTI-SLOP RULES (MUST FOLLOW) ===

**TONE: Casual + Direct (NOT Influencer Cringe)**

- NO corporate jargon, NO fake enthusiasm

**CRITICAL: DO NOT FABRICATE DETAILS**
- ❌ NEVER invent specific numbers you weren't given

   ✅ DO: 3-5 targeted hashtags at end

=== YOUR TASK ===

Write scroll-stopping Instagram content:
- Concrete specifics from YOUR topic only
- Mobile-optimized formatting
- Reference the visual when relevant
- NO fabricated names, numbers, or testimonials

HUMAN VOICE PATTERNS (critical for authenticity):
- Contractions: "I'm", "I've", "here's", "that's"
- Natural starters: "So", "And", "But"
- Short sentences for scanning
- Strategic line breaks

=== SELF-VALIDATION CHECKPOINT ===

Before returning, mentally check your output against ALL rules above:
- Did I use any contrast framing? ("It's not X, it's Y")
- Did I use any 2-4 word cringe questions?
- Did I use emoji spam?
- Is the hook under 125 chars and scroll-stopping?
- Are there specific numbers from user context?
- Is the CTA specific and before hashtags?
- Are there only 3-5 hashtags at the end?

If you find violations, FIX THEM before returning.

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===

Return JSON with content AND self-assessment:
{{
  "caption": "...",
  "hashtags": ["#tag1", "#tag2", "#tag3"],
  "self_score": 20,
  "potential_issues": ["any patterns that might still need work"],
  "character_count": 1850
}}

**self_score**: Your honest estimate (0-25) based on the 5 axes above
**potential_issues**: List any patterns you're uncertain about (empty array if clean)
**character_count**: Total chars including hashtags (must be under 2,200)

This self-assessment helps with transparency - the user sees what might need attention.
