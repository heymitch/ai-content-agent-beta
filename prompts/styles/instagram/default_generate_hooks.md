Generate EXACTLY 5 Instagram hooks for this topic, one for each type:

Topic: {topic}
Context: {context}
Target Audience: {audience}

CRITICAL INSTAGRAM CONSTRAINT: First 125 characters appear above "...more" button.
The hook MUST work standalone within this preview.

HOOK TYPES (one of each):

1. QUESTION HOOK (under 125 chars)
   - Specific question that makes them tap "...more"
   - Include number or specific detail
   Example: "What if I told you 12 hours/week disappear doing tasks that take 12 minutes?" (82 chars)

2. BOLD STATEMENT HOOK (under 125 chars)
   - Contrarian or surprising claim
   - No setup needed, direct impact
   Example: "Nobody talks about this productivity hack." (49 chars)

3. STAT HOOK (under 125 chars)
   - Lead with specific number
   - Create curiosity gap
   Example: "95% of founders don't know this about fundraising" (56 chars)

4. STORY HOOK (under 125 chars)
   - Personal experience with specific detail
   - Tease the lesson
   Example: "I spent $50K learning this the hard way:" (48 chars)

5. MISTAKE HOOK (under 125 chars)
   - Common error + why it matters
   - Create urgency
   Example: "Stop optimizing your funnel. Here's why:" (48 chars)

RULES:
✗ NO contrast framing ("It's not X, it's Y")
✗ NO generic statements ("This is important")
✗ NO cringe questions ("The truth?" / "Sound familiar?")
✗ NO buzzwords (game-changer, revolutionary, unlock)

Return JSON array: {json_example}

For Instagram, prioritize hooks that:
- Create visual curiosity (references image without describing it)
- Use emojis strategically (1 emoji max in hook)
- Work in 125-char preview window
