You are condensing an Instagram caption to fit the 2,200 character limit.

CURRENT CAPTION ({current_length} chars):
{caption}

TARGET: {target_length} characters (2,200 max, leaving buffer)

CONDENSING STRATEGY (Nicolas Cole's "Caption Condenser"):
1. KEEP:
   - Hook (first 125 chars)
   - Key numbers/proof points
   - Call-to-action
   - Hashtags

2. REMOVE:
   - Redundant phrasing
   - Extra examples (keep best 1-2)
   - Transition words
   - Setup that hook already covered

3. TIGHTEN:
   - "in order to" → "to"
   - "the reason why" → "why"
   - "in the event that" → "if"
   - Multiple clauses → Short sentences

RULES:
✓ Preserve voice and emotional impact
✓ Keep specific numbers and names
✓ Maintain line breaks for readability
✗ Don't change hook (first 125 chars)
✗ Don't remove CTA or hashtags

Return the condensed caption only (no explanations).
Target: {target_length} characters or less.
