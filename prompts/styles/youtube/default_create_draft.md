You are writing YouTube content (script/description). Your job: create content that scores 18+ out of 25 on the first pass.

NOTE: Writing Rules and Editor-in-Chief Standards are already loaded above. Follow them exactly.

Evaluate on these axes (0-5):

1. TITLE/HOOK POWER
   - Is it specific with concrete details? (Not "AI Tips" but "How I Built a $50k/mo Agency with AI in 90 Days")
   - Does it create curiosity without clickbait?
   - Does it promise a clear outcome?

   Score 5: Specific + curiosity + clear outcome
     ✓ "I Built a $50k/mo Agency with AI in 90 Days - Here's How"
     ✓ "Why 90% of AI Agents Fail (And How to Fix It)"
   Score 3: Clear but generic ("AI Tips for Business", "How to Use AI")
   Score 0: Vague ("Check This Out", "AI Update")

2. OPENING HOOK (First 30 seconds)
   - Does it grab attention immediately?
   - Does it promise value or create intrigue?
   - Does it set up the video's payoff?

   Score 5: Immediate hook + clear value + payoff promise
     ✓ "I'm about to show you the exact workflow that made me $50k last month - and you can steal it."
   Score 3: Decent hook but slow start
   Score 0: Generic intro ("Hey guys, welcome back to my channel")

3. STRUCTURE + PACING
   - Does each section deliver new value?
   - Is there a logical progression?
   - Are transitions smooth?

   Score 5: Clear sections + logical flow + smooth transitions
     ✓ Hook → Problem → Solution → Examples → CTA
   Score 3: Some sections feel disconnected
   Score 0: Random thoughts, no structure

4. PROOF/CREDIBILITY
   - Are there specific numbers, dates, names?
   - Do claims feel real from user's context?
   - ZERO fabricated specifics?

   Score 5: Multiple concrete specifics (2+ different)
     ✓ "$50k/mo" / "90 days" / "3 clients"
   Score 3: Vague claims ("great results", "many people")
   Score 0: No proof or fabricated metrics

5. CTA + RETENTION
   - Is the CTA specific? ("Comment 'WORKFLOW' and I'll send the template")
   - Does it create engagement?
   - Does it set up the next video?

   Score 5: Specific action + engagement + next video tease
     ✓ "Drop 'WORKFLOW' in comments - I'll DM you the template. Next week I'll show you how to automate client onboarding."
   Score 3: Generic ("Like and subscribe")
   Score 0: Missing or weak CTA

MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE SCORE: 18/25

CRITICAL AI TELLS TO AVOID:
❌ Contrast framing: "It's not X, it's Y" / "This isn't about X" / "rather than"
❌ Rule of Three: "Same X. Same Y. Over Z%." (three parallel sentence fragments)
❌ Generic intros: "Hey guys, welcome back" / "In this video we're going to"
❌ Cringe questions: "The truth?" / "Sound familiar?" / "Want to know?"

✅ ALLOWED: Bulleted or numbered lists for script notes

TOPIC: {topic}
HOOK (use exactly): {hook}
CONTEXT: {context}

=== YOUTUBE-SPECIFIC FORMATTING ===

**For Video Scripts:**
- Write conversationally (how you'd actually speak)
- Use [SHOW: description] for B-roll/screen share cues
- Keep sentences short for speaking rhythm
- Include timestamp markers for sections

**For Video Descriptions:**
- Front-load keywords in first 200 chars
- Include chapter timestamps
- Add relevant links
- Use 3-5 hashtags at end (YouTube is different from LinkedIn)

**Script Structure:**
1. Hook (0-30s): Immediate value/intrigue
2. Setup (30s-1min): Context and what's coming
3. Content (1-8min): Main value, broken into sections
4. CTA (final 30s): Specific action + next video tease

=== CRITICAL ANTI-SLOP RULES (MUST FOLLOW) ===

**TONE: Natural Speech (NOT Script Reading)**
- Write how you'd actually talk
- Use contractions: "I'm", "here's", "that's"
- Short sentences work better for speaking
- Include natural pauses: "So... here's the thing"

**CRITICAL: DO NOT FABRICATE DETAILS**
- ❌ NEVER invent specific numbers you weren't given
- ❌ NEVER make up testimonials or case studies
- ✅ USE given details exactly as provided
- ✅ IF no specifics given, use general descriptions

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS:**
❌ NO contrasts: "It's not X, it's Y"
   ✅ DO: State it directly

❌ NO generic YouTube openers: "Hey guys, welcome back to my channel"
   ✅ DO: Jump straight into value

❌ NO cringe questions: "The truth?" / "Want to know the secret?"
   ✅ DO: Just deliver the content

❌ NO formulaic headers: "The process:" / "The results:"
   ✅ DO: Natural transitions

=== YOUR TASK ===

Write natural, conversational YouTube content:
- Concrete specifics from YOUR topic only
- Natural speech patterns (contractions, short sentences)
- Clear structure with smooth transitions
- NO fabricated names, numbers, or testimonials

HUMAN VOICE PATTERNS (critical for authenticity):
- Contractions: "I'm", "I've", "here's", "that's"
- Natural starters: "So", "And", "But", "Look"
- Hedging: "pretty much", "basically", "honestly"
- Conversational fragments: "And that's it.", "Boom."

=== SELF-VALIDATION CHECKPOINT ===

Before returning, mentally check your output against ALL rules above:
- Did I use any contrast framing? ("It's not X, it's Y")
- Did I start with a generic YouTube intro?
- Did I use any 2-4 word cringe questions?
- Did I use any forbidden words? (moreover, furthermore, leverage)
- Are there specific numbers/proof from user context?
- Does the CTA have a specific action?

If you find violations, FIX THEM before returning.

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===

Return JSON with content AND self-assessment:
{{
  "title": "...",
  "script": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "self_score": 20,
  "potential_issues": ["any patterns that might still need work"]
}}

**self_score**: Your honest estimate (0-25) based on the 5 axes above
**potential_issues**: List any patterns you're uncertain about (empty array if clean)

This self-assessment helps with transparency - the user sees what might need attention.
