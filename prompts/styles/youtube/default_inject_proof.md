=== INJECT PROOF POINTS ===

Review this script and ONLY add proof from verified sources.

Draft: {draft}
Topic: {topic}
Industry: {industry}

**COMPANY DOCUMENTS SEARCH RESULTS:**
{proof_context}

**WHERE PROOF CAN COME FROM:**
1. **TOPIC/CONTEXT** - User explicitly provided: "Alex 500→5k subs", "workshop with 50+ creators"
2. **WEB SEARCH RESULTS** - Verified via web_search tool (future): industry benchmarks
3. **COMPANY DOCUMENTS** - Retrieved from user-uploaded docs (case studies, testimonials, product docs) - SEE ABOVE

**CRITICAL: DO NOT FABRICATE**
- ❌ Making up creator names: "Sarah grew her channel"
- ❌ Inventing growth numbers: "10k subscribers in 2 months"
- ❌ Fabricating case studies: "tested with 100 channels"
- ❌ Creating fake metrics: "234% engagement", "4.5M views"

**WHAT YOU CAN DO:**
- ✅ Use names from TOPIC: "Alex" → "Alex went from 500 to 5k"
- ✅ Use numbers from TOPIC: "50+ creators" → "workshop with 50+ creators"
- ✅ Add context from TOPIC: "3 months" → "in just 3 months"
- ✅ Add verified web search results (when tool provides them)

**DEFAULT BEHAVIOR:**
- If NO additional proof available → Return draft with MINIMAL changes
- Better to have NO proof than FAKE proof

Return the enhanced script only (plain text, line breaks for pauses allowed).
