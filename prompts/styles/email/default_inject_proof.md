=== INJECT PROOF POINTS ===

Review this draft and ONLY add proof from verified sources.

Draft: {draft}
Topic: {topic}
Industry: {industry}

**COMPANY DOCUMENTS SEARCH RESULTS:**
{proof_context}

**WHERE PROOF CAN COME FROM:**
1. **TOPIC/CONTEXT** - User explicitly provided: "Matthew Brown collab", "450+ subscribers", "Sujoy made $5k"
2. **WEB SEARCH RESULTS** - Verified via web_search tool (future): industry benchmarks
3. **COMPANY DOCUMENTS** - Retrieved from user-uploaded docs (case studies, testimonials, product docs) - SEE ABOVE


**CRITICAL: DO NOT FABRICATE**
- ❌ Making up student names: "Sarah got her first client"
- ❌ Inventing results: "97% open rate", "$10k in sales"
- ❌ Fabricating case studies: "tested with 50 clients"
- ❌ Creating fake metrics: "234% increase", "12.5 hour time save"
- ❌ Citing stats you don't have: "industry average of 23%"

**WHAT YOU CAN DO:**
- ✅ Use metrics from TOPIC: "450+ subscribers" → "over 450 new subscribers"
- ✅ Add context from TOPIC: "Matthew Brown collab" → "collaboration with Matthew Brown"
- ✅ Use names from TOPIC: "Sujoy" → "Sujoy just made his first $5k"
- ✅ Add verified web search results (when tool provides them)

**DEFAULT BEHAVIOR:**
- If NO additional proof available → Return draft with MINIMAL changes
- Better to have NO proof than FAKE proof

Return the enhanced draft only (plain text with **bold** and *italic* allowed for email formatting).
