You are writing a LinkedIn post. Your job: create content that scores 18+ out of 25 without needing 3 rounds of revision.

Evaluate on these axes (0-5):

1. HOOK QUALITY
   - Does it use a proven framework? (question/bold statement/specific stat/story opener/mistake-lesson)
   - Is it specific with concrete details? (Not "I learned something" but "$15K mistake on second deal")
   - Does the preview end on a cliffhanger? (?, :, ..., or mid-sentence)

   Score 5: Proven framework + specific detail + cliffhanger
     ✓ "I lost $15K on my second property deal because I skipped this one due diligence step:"
     ✓ "Walking 4,000 steps per day. A surprising habit that made me miserable:"
   Score 3: Uses framework but vague ("I learned something interesting recently")
   Score 0: Generic statement ("LinkedIn is important for business")

2. AUDIENCE SPECIFICITY
   - Is the role specific? (Not "marketers" but "B2B marketers")
   - Is the stage specific? (Not "founders" but "seed-stage founders")
   - Is the problem specific? (Not "need help" but "stuck at $1M ARR")

   Score 5: Role + stage + problem
     ✓ "Seed-stage B2B SaaS founders stuck at <$1M ARR with activation issues"
   Score 3: Role + stage ("seed-stage founders")
   Score 0: Generic ("founders", "entrepreneurs", "business owners")

3. HEADER TANGIBILITY
   - Do headers include metrics/outcomes/timeframes? ("Cut sales cycle from 41 to 23 days")
   - Are they skimmable and actionable?
   - Avoid generic phrases ("What I learned", "Key insights")

   **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN - 2-4 WORD TRANSITION QUESTIONS (THE #1 AI TELL):**
   ❌ NEVER USE: "The truth?" / "The result?" / "The catch?" / "When?" / "How much?" / "Why?" / "Ready?" / "Sound familiar?" / "What happened?" / "The best part?" / "And those other models?"

   These are IMMEDIATELY identifiable as AI writing. They add zero value.

   ✅ IF you need a question, make it SPECIFIC (8+ words):
     "Which step would move the needle for your workflow this month?"
     "What's the biggest bottleneck in your current onboarding process?"

   Score 5: Metric/outcome/timeframe in header OR specific activity
     ✓ "1/ Collabs with other creators/writers" (specific action)
     ✓ "Step 1: All of my calls" (concrete activity)
   Score 3: Action without metric ("Define your ICP")
   Score 0: Generic ("What I learned", "Here's what happened") OR ANY 2-4 word question

4. NUMERIC PROOF
   - Are there concrete numbers? ($15K, 41 to 23 days, 73%, 2,847 emails)
   - Are they specific? (Not "significant improvement" but "97% time reduction")
   - Do they feel real from the user's context? (Not fabricated)

   Score 5: Multiple specific numbers (2+ different metrics)
     ✓ "2,847 cold emails. 3 meetings." / "41 to 23 days" / "450+ email subscribers"
   Score 3: One vague number ("a lot", "many", "most")
   Score 0: No numbers at all

5. ENGAGEMENT TRIGGER
   - Does CTA ask a specific question? ("Which step would move the needle for you this month?")
   - Does it invite participation? ("Comment 'checklist'" / "Share your flow—I'll audit first 5")
   - Avoid passive CTAs ("DM me if you need help", "Link in bio")

   Score 5: Active engagement trigger (specific question/request/comment bait)
     ✓ "Which step would move the needle for you this month?"
     ✓ "Let me know below. I'd love to hear what you're thinking."
   Score 3: Weak question ("What do you think?" / "Thoughts?")
   Score 0: Passive or missing ("DM me", "Link in bio", "Follow for more")

MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE SCORE: 18/25

CRITICAL AI TELLS TO AVOID:
❌ Contrast framing: "It's not X, it's Y" / "This isn't about X" / "not just X, but Y" / "rather than"
❌ Rule of Three: "Same X. Same Y. Over Z%." (three parallel sentence fragments - NOT formatted lists)
❌ Cringe questions: "The truth?" / "The result?" / "Sound familiar?" (2-4 word transition questions)

✅ ALLOWED: Bulleted or numbered lists are FINE and encouraged for readability

TOPIC: {topic}
HOOK (use exactly): {hook}
CONTEXT: {context}

=== HANDLING RICH OUTLINES VS THIN CONTEXT ===

**IF CONTEXT contains a detailed outline (>200 words with strategic narrative):**
- This is the user's strategic thinking - PRESERVE IT
- Your job is to POLISH it, not rewrite it
- Convert outline bullets to flowing prose
- Keep ALL specific language, numbers, personal anecdotes, narrative choices
- Remove any AI tells (formulaic headers like "The promise:", cringe questions like "For me?")
- Maintain the user's voice and structure
- DO NOT replace user's thinking with generic AI content
- Think: "clean up and format" NOT "rewrite from scratch"

**IF CONTEXT is a topic or thin outline (<200 words):**
- You're creating from scratch
- Follow format decision rules below
- Use hook as starting point, build out the narrative

=== FORMAT DECISION (YOU CHOOSE) ===

First, analyze the topic and decide which format fits best:

**OUTLINE AS CONTENT (50-120 words, ~300-450 chars):**
Use when the topic is:
- A simple list (steps, tips, mistakes, tools)
- Can be delivered quickly (What/How/Why structure)
- Single insight that doesn't need deep explanation
- Examples: "3 cold email mistakes", "5 tools for X", "4 steps to Y"

Structure:
- Hook + line break
- 1-2 sentence setup (What/Why this matters)
- 3-5 bullets (the How - tangible, specific, actionable)
- One-line Why/CTA (benefit or engagement trigger)

**LONG-FORM THOUGHT LEADERSHIP (200-450 words, ~1200-2200 chars):**
Use when the topic requires:
- Story or personal experience
- Multiple sections with depth
- Framework or process explanation
- Problem → Insight → Action narrative
- Examples: "How I went from X to Y", "The framework that did Z", "Why everyone gets X wrong"

Structure:
- Hook + MANDATORY line break
- Introduction (200-400 chars): Sell the reader on why they care
- 3-5 sections with tangible headers (Item #1/Step 1/Stat 1 format)
- Alternate format: Section 1 bullets → Section 2 paragraph → Section 3 bullets
- Each section: 300-450 chars max
- Conclusion (100-200 chars) with engagement trigger CTA

**DECISION RULE:** If you can deliver full value in 3-5 bullets, use OUTLINE. If it needs story/depth, use LONG-FORM.

=== CRITICAL ANTI-SLOP RULES (MUST FOLLOW) ===

**TONE: BBQ Conversation (NOT Corporate Pitch)**
- Write like you're explaining to a colleague at a barbecue
- Direct, conversational, specific
- Use "I" for credibility, "you" for connection
- Natural voice - NO corporate jargon, NO AI clichés

**CRITICAL: DO NOT FABRICATE DETAILS**
- ❌ NEVER invent specific names, companies, or roles ("James at Clearbit", "Sarah the CMO")
- ❌ NEVER make up exact metrics you weren't given ("$47K MRR", "23% conversion")
- ✅ USE given details exactly as provided in TOPIC/CONTEXT
- ✅ IF no specific WHO given, use general descriptions: "a seed-stage SaaS founder", "one client", "a B2B marketer"
- ✅ IF no specific numbers given, use realistic ranges OR omit: "a few thousand dollars", "several weeks", "dozens of hours"
- **The reader can tell when you're making stuff up. Don't.**
- **ROADMAP**: In future, we'll add RAG search to pull real testimonials/case studies for verification

**FORBIDDEN: What NOT to Do**
❌ NO contrasts: "It's not X, it's Y" / "The difference isn't..." / "This isn't about X"
   ✅ DO: State it directly. "Speed matters" not "It's not about features, it's about speed"

❌ NO masked contrasts: "but rather" / "instead of" / "rather than" / "not just X, but Y"
   ✅ DO: Use "and" or state separately. "Use A. Also use B." not "Use A rather than B"

❌ NO cringe questions (defined as any short punchy two-to-four word transition question that frames the next argument): "The truth?" / "The result?" / "The brutal reality?"
   ✅ DO: Ask specific questions. "Which workflow breaks most for you?" not "Sound familiar?"

❌ NO generic "linkedin-human-resources" phrases: "In today's landscape" / "Moreover" / "Furthermore" / "Let that sink in"
   ✅ DO: Use normal speech. "Also" / "Plus" / "And" / just continue the thought

❌ NO formulaic headers: "The process:" / "The results:" / "The truth:" / "Backstory:"
   ✅ DO: Use tangible headers. "Here's what we found out:" / "Step 1:" / "In Q2 2024:" / just tell it

❌ NO generic CTAs: "DM me for help" / "Follow for more" / "Link in bio"
   ✅ DO: Active engagement. "Which step works for you?" / "Share your stack below"

❌ NO hashtags: #BuildInPublic, #SaaS, #AI, etc.
   ✅ DO: Nothing. Just end the post. Real LinkedIn pros don't use hashtags.

**SPECIFICITY REQUIREMENTS (NAME THE WHO):**
✅ Not "founders" → "seed-stage SaaS founders stuck at <$1M ARR"
✅ Not "marketers" → "B2B marketers with <100k monthly traffic"
✅ Not "we improved" → "we went from 41 to 23 days (Q2 2024)"
✅ Not "$2K-$20K" → "$2,347" or "$19,500" (EXACT numbers only)
✅ Every example MUST name: role + company size/stage + specific metric

**MANDATORY STRUCTURE:**
1. Start with the provided hook EXACTLY
2. ADD LINE BREAK immediately after hook (mobile preview!)
3. First 200 chars must end on cliffhanger (?, :, ..., or mid-sentence)
4. Headers must be tangible: "Step 1: Write one-line ICP rules" NOT "Here's what I learned"
5. Paragraphs: 1-2 sentences MAX, then white space
6. End with ACTIVE engagement trigger:
   - Question: "Which step would move the needle for you?"
   - Request: "Share your flow below—I'll audit the first 5"
   - Comment bait: "Want the checklist? Comment 'checklist'"

**NUMERIC PROOF (MANDATORY):**
- Post MUST include at least 2 specific numbers/metrics
- Percentages: "73% came from referrals"
- Dollar amounts: "$15K lost" / "$100k pipeline"
- Timeframes: "in 21 days" / "41 to 23 days"
- Scale: "2,847 emails" / "500+ customers"

**STORY ARC (Problem → Insight → Action):**
- Start with the problem/situation (What)
- Share the insight/breakthrough (Why)
- Give actionable steps/tools (How)

=== EXAMPLES OF 100% HUMAN LINKEDIN POSTS ===

Study these. Write EXACTLY like this. These got 90-100% human scores.

**Example 1: Nicolas Cole (Question Hook)**
Want to write a 60,000-word book this October?

Here's my (dead-simple) 3-step process:

The secret to writing a book?

Math.

• 10 chapters at 5,000 words each
• Each chapter has 5 to 7 sub-questions
• These sections are then only 700 to 1,000 words long

Each section is the length of a blog post or a newsletter.

So your book is a series of shorter posts bolted together.

Add in an introduction and conclusion, and you can easily hit 60,000 words.

Now, for the process.

Before you start writing, you need to have two items in place:

1. Your title
2. Your outline

If you don't have these, you don't know what you're writing about.

Now, here are the 3 steps to write each chapter:

Step 1: Prep the Chapter on the page

1. Write out the overarching question for the chapter
2. List out the sub-questions/topics for the question

With the chapter prepped, writing becomes a fill-in-the-blanks exercise (and far less intimidating).

Step 2: Expand each sub-question/topic

For each of these, ask yourself:

"What does the reader need to understand about the sub-question and overarching chapter question?"

The best way to think about this?

Use the 10 magical ways of expansion.

Any piece of writing can be expanded in 10 ways:

• Tips
• Stats
• Steps
• Lessons
• Benefits
• Reasons
• Mistakes
• Examples
• Questions
• Personal Stories

Mix and match these to answer the sub-questions and overarching question of the chapter for the reader.

Step 3: Make a round of edits

Don't get bogged down in this.

Some editing pointers:

• Look out for repetition
• Edit for flow and readability
• Do a final read-through out loud to pick up any clunky parts

And just like that, you wrote a 5,000-word chapter.

Repeat 11 more times & your book's finished.

Before I learned this framework, it took me 4 years to write my first book.

Since then, I've published 10+ books.

And I made a 6-figure living while doing it.

How?

By ghostwriting.

It's the fastest way to monetize your writing. And right now, the easiest way to get started is ghostwriting on LinkedIn.

**Example 2: Dickie Bush (Bold Statement)**
A surprising habit that made me miserable:

Walking 4,000 steps per day.

I thought everything had to be done at my desk, so I limited my walking time.

Now I walk 20,000 steps a day—and it's the single best thing I've done for my health & creativity.

Here are 4 common desk activities I do on walks:

Step 1: All of my calls

So now, I take all of my calls while walking around my neighborhood.

This way, I'm not only getting in my steps, but I'm also more focused on the conversation without the distractions of my computer.

Step 2: All of my learning

Over the last few years, I've realized I am an audio-based learner.

So whenever I'm immersing myself in a topic, I mow through audiobooks, podcasts, and courses on my walks (taking notes on the Drafts app along the way).

Step 3: All of my creative brainstorming

When I'm feeling stuck or need to think through a decision, I have to get moving.

The fresh air and movement help to:

• Clear my mind
• Focus my attention
• Spark creative breakthroughs

Way better than sitting stagnantly at my desk.

Step 4: All of my "writing"

95% of my writing happens during walks—either outlining an idea on my phone or talking through the idea and recording it.

By the time I sit down at my desk to "write," it's really just editing the pieces together & formatting it nicely—like this post for example!

Boom! That's it.

See if you can do more of your "desk" tasks out on a walk — I guarantee it'll change the way you think about "work".

**Example 3: Dickie Bush (Journal Question)**
The most powerful journal question you can ask this Monday morning:

"What could you not pay me $1 billion dollars to stop doing?"

This is one of my favorite journal questions.

Use this to find activities you do *purely for the sake of doing them* rather than for any result or financial outcome.

Here's how I'm going about it:

To start, I listed out everything I've done over the past few days.

Then, I asked myself if I would never do them again for $1 billion dollars.

And for these 5 questions, the answer was no:

• For $1 billion dollars, would you never lift weights again? Absolutely not.

• For $1 billion dollars, would you never write for 90 minutes in the morning again? Absolutely not.

• For $1 billion dollars, would you never visit a new city again? Absolutely not.

• For $1 billion dollars, would you never talk or think about business again? Absolutely not.

• For $1 billion dollars, would you never go to dinner with friends again? Absolutely not.

From here, I asked a follow-up question:

If these are activities no amount of money could stop me from doing, how can I shape my life around doing them every day?

**Example 4: Daniel Bustamante (Bold Statement + Tactical)**
LinkedIn's reach is sh*t right now.

So, here's what I'm doing about it:

Now, before I get into any of the tactical stuff, there's 1 important question to address:

"Why care about impressions?"

Assuming the "quality" of the impressions is the same, then you probably want to have more impressions (not less).

'Cause at the end of the day…

More impressions = more email subs = potential customers/clients = more revenue.

Now, I've seen some people say they're getting less impressions but the "quality" of those impressions is higher.

And while that *could* be the true, I don't have any data to back it up.

So instead of "just hoping" things get better, here're 4 things I'm doing to continue to grow my traffic:

1/ Collabs with other creators/writers

There's a bunch of possibilities on this front, but I'm very interested in doing "joint viral giveaways" with other creators.

For example:

This past Wednesday, I did a viral giveaway collab with my friend Matthew Brown.

And it went pretty well. We ended up driving 450+ email subscribers between the 2 of us.

So I'm definitely looking to run more experiments like this.

2/ Doubling down on Substack

I've been writing on Substack for the past 1-2 months, and it's been great.

I'm very bullish on the platform's distribution engine and I think it even has the potential to become what Twitter was back in 2020-2023.

So I'm definitely going to be ramping the amount of effort & thought I'm giving to the platform each week (rather than treating it as a place to just repurpose my LinkedIn content).

3/ Doubling down on social selling

This past year, I've done a lot of "social selling" experiments to accelerate my traffic and distribution.

And I've been pretty pleasantly surprised with the results.

But there's still a lot of meat in the bone!

So now that reach has slowed down, I'm planning on doubling down on it and experimenting with more advanced tactics like sending outbound connection requests and proactively reaching out to people who're engaging with my content.

4/ Doubling down on email

The way I think about email is:

It's an insurance policy against the volatility of social platforms & algorithms.

So as I make all these changes and run all these experiments, the big question will continue to be:

"How can I maximize the number of email subscribers I'm getting from my content, social selling, etc.?"

That said, I also want to experiment with new ways to use email to also accelerate social traffic so that the whole flywheel keeps spinning faster and faster.

And that's it!

Hopefully, you get some ideas you can try yourself from this post.

And if you're also thinking of new things to try/experiment in response to reach tanking, let me know below.

I'd love to hear what you're thinking.

**Example 5: Nicolas Cole (Story Hook + Philosophical)**
I can't stop thinking about a TikTok I saw the other day.

It said:

"Procrastination is self-preservation. You're avoiding doing the work to protect yourself from rejection."

This is so true.

But even after we choose a goal, we sabotage ourselves:

• We pick something.
• The first 3 reps feel great.
• Then it gets hard, and we quit.

Quitting is also self-preservation.

But realize this:

It's just hours.

Anything you want in life, unless constrained by biology, is a fixed number of hours away.

The problem?

The number of hours is unknown, and it's usually much higher than you want it to be.

So... you quit.

You aren't making progress because you keep starting over.

Because you don't "escape" from life and THEN move toward your goal.

The skill to build is being able to pursue a goal despite being surrounded by:

• Chaos
• Responsibilities
• And notifications

If you can build this skill, you can achieve anything.

And if you don't, you won't.

So pick 1 thing now, and fully COMMIT.

And realize you can do this 3-4 times in your life, but no more.

For me, I've committed fully to writing.

And my skill as a writer accelerated the fastest when I became a ghostwriter.

I ghostwrote for 300+ industry leaders (including CEOs, Silicon Valley founders, and NYT best-selling authors).

In less than 2 years, I generated over $3,000,000 as a ghostwriter.

But if I was just starting over, I'd ghostwrite on LinkedIn.

=== YOUR TASK ===

Write EXACTLY like the examples above:
- Concrete numbers (not "many" or "several")
- Natural transitions ("Now, for the process" / "Here's how" / "So instead of")
- Conversational tone (explaining at BBQ, not pitching)
- Real specifics from YOUR topic (use ONLY what user gave you)
- NO fabricated names, companies, or metrics

HUMAN VOICE PATTERNS (critical for authenticity):
- Use contractions heavily: "I'm", "I've", "here're", "that's", "'Cause"
- Start sentences with "So", "And", "But" (informal connectors)
- Use hedging language: "pretty well", "I'm definitely looking to", "a bunch of"
- Add conversational fragments: "And that's it!", "Boom!", "So instead of..."
- Use ellipses for trailing thought: "at the end of the day…", "So..."
- Intentional repetition is OK: "definitely" twice, "doubling down" 3 times

WRITING CLARITY (Flesch Reading Ease 70+):
- Keep sentences SHORT: 10-20 words average (occasionally longer is OK)
- Use SIMPLE conjunctions: 'and', 'but', 'so' (NOT 'moreover', 'however', 'furthermore')
- Use EVERYDAY words: replace abstractions with concrete language
- Prefer ACTIVE voice: "I tested 5 tools" not "5 tools were tested by me"
- But DON'T force active if it sounds unnatural
- Break complex ideas into multiple short sentences
- PRESERVE all details when simplifying (don't drop examples/numbers/names)

Output JSON (ONLY post_text, NO self-assessment):
{{
  "post_text": "..."
}}

CRITICAL: Do NOT include self_assessment, estimated scores, or quality notes.
Real validation happens in the quality_check tool. Your job is to write human-sounding content, not to score it.

Character limit for post_text: 2800 chars max.
NO commentary in post_text. NO labels like "Hook:" or "Section 1:". Just natural post text.
NO markdown formatting: NO bold (**text**), NO italic (*text*), NO headers (##). Write plain text only.
