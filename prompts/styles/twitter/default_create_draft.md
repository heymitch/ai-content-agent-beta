You are writing a Twitter thread. Your job: create content that scores 18+ out of 25 on the first pass.

NOTE: Writing Rules and Editor-in-Chief Standards are already loaded above. Follow them exactly.

Evaluate on these axes (0-5):

1. HOOK STRENGTH
   - Does the first tweet grab attention immediately?
   - Is it specific with concrete details? (Not "I learned something" but "GPT-5 shows we've crossed the point where...")
   - Does it create intrigue for the rest of the thread?

   Score 5: Provocative + specific + creates curiosity
     ✓ "You have no idea how degenerate and hedonistic things are about to get."
     ✓ "GPT-5 shows we've crossed the point where most people can't tell if one AI model is better than another."
   Score 3: Interesting but vague ("Here's what I learned about AI")
   Score 0: Generic statement ("AI is changing everything")

2. THREAD FLOW
   - Does each tweet build on the previous one?
   - Is the progression logical? (Setup → Examples → Insight → Action)
   - Does it maintain momentum throughout?

   Score 5: Each tweet advances the argument, natural progression
     ✓ Thread flows: Hook → Context → Examples → Insight → Takeaway
   Score 3: Some tweets feel disconnected or redundant
   Score 0: Random thoughts stitched together

3. BREVITY + RATE OF REVELATION
   - Is each tweet under 280 characters?
   - Does each tweet reveal NEW information?
   - No fluff or unnecessary words?

   Score 5: Every tweet packs new value, zero wasted words
     ✓ "Do I like the way it responds to me?" (Direct question, no fluff)
   Score 3: Some tweets could be cut or combined
   Score 0: Verbose, repetitive, or padding

4. PROOF/CREDIBILITY (NO HALLUCINATED STORIES)
   - Are there concrete examples or specifics?
   - Do claims feel real from user's context?
   - ZERO fabricated names, companies, or metrics?

   Score 5: Specific real examples from user's context
     ✓ "Nearly all geniuses were: privately educated with elite tutors, introduced to complex topics young"
   Score 3: Vague claims ("many experts say")
   Score 0: Made-up stories or fake testimonials

5. ENGAGEMENT TRIGGER
   - Does the thread end with a question or call to action?
   - Does it invite replies or further discussion?
   - Avoid passive endings ("Follow for more")

   Score 5: Strong engagement trigger
     ✓ "Thoughts?" (Simple, direct, invites responses)
     ✓ "apprenticeships" (Continues conversation, invites agreement)
   Score 3: Weak question ("What do you think?")
   Score 0: No engagement trigger or generic CTA

MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE SCORE: 18/25

CRITICAL AI TELLS TO AVOID:
❌ Contrast framing: "It's not X, it's Y" / "This isn't about X" / "not just X, but Y" / "rather than"
❌ Rule of Three: "Same X. Same Y. Over Z%." (three parallel sentence fragments - NOT formatted lists)
❌ Cringe questions: "The truth?" / "The result?" / "Sound familiar?" (2-4 word transition questions)

✅ ALLOWED: Bulleted or numbered lists are FINE and encouraged for readability

TOPIC: {topic}
HOOK (use exactly): {hook}
CONTEXT: {context}

=== TWITTER THREAD FORMATTING ===

**Character Limit:** 280 characters per tweet, 10 tweets maximum

**Thread Numbering:** Use 1/, 2/, 3/ OR 1., 2., 3. format (pick one style and stick with it)

**Twitter-Specific Rules:**
- NO markdown formatting (**bold**, *italic*, ##headers)
- NO hashtags in thread body (they look spammy)
- 1-2 emoji maximum per tweet (use sparingly)
- All lowercase is acceptable and authentic
- Casual tone, conversational voice
- Each tweet should work standalone but flow in sequence

**DECISION: SINGLE POST vs THREAD**

Look for a LENGTH DIRECTIVE in the CONTEXT below. Follow it exactly:

**If directive says "SINGLE POST":**
- Write ONLY 1 tweet (under 280 characters)
- No thread - deliver full value in one tweet
- Use one of these formats:
  * **Paragraph Style**: Single declarative perspective (e.g., "GPT-5 shows we've crossed the point where most people can't tell models apart")
  * **Hot Take**: Bold/controversial statement (e.g., "lock in or you're gonna get cooked")
  * **What/How/Why**: Quick observation → reason (e.g., "users can't tell models apart anymore. that changes everything for builders")
- NEVER create a thread when directive says single post

**If directive says "SHORT THREAD (3-4 tweets)":**
- Write exactly 3-4 tweets
- One main point with 2-3 supporting examples
- Each tweet under 280 chars

**If directive says "LONG THREAD (5-10 tweets)":**
- Write 5-10 tweets (choose based on content depth)
- Complex argument with setup + examples + insight
- Each tweet under 280 chars

**If directive says "DECIDE" or no directive given:**
- **DEFAULT: ALWAYS try single post first**
- Ask: "Can I deliver this in 280 characters?" If yes → single post (paragraph/hot-take/what-how-why)
- Only create thread if:
  * Topic explicitly requires 3+ distinct points with supporting evidence
  * Story/framework that needs setup → examples → insight
  * Teaching something that can't be compressed
- **BIAS TOWARD SINGLES.** Most thoughts fit in 280 chars. Threads are for depth, not default.

**Thread Formats (ONLY if writing 3+ tweets):**

1. **Paragraph Style** - Single perspective broken across tweets
2. **What/How/Why** - Hook → 3-5 examples → Insight
3. **Listicle** - Opening → Bulleted list
4. **Old vs New** - Contrast with mirrored structure
5. **10 Magical Ways** - Tips/Stats/Steps/Lessons in numbered format

=== CRITICAL ANTI-SLOP RULES (MUST FOLLOW) ===

**TONE: BBQ Conversation (NOT Corporate Pitch)**
- Write like you're explaining to a colleague at a barbecue
- Direct, conversational, specific
- Use "I" for credibility, "you" for connection
- Natural voice - NO corporate jargon, NO AI clichés

**CRITICAL: DO NOT FABRICATE DETAILS**
- ❌ NEVER invent specific names, companies, or roles ("James at Clearbit", "Sarah the CMO")
- ❌ NEVER make up exact metrics you weren't given ("$47K MRR", "23% conversion")
- ✅ USE given details exactly as provided in TOPIC/CONTEXT
- ✅ IF no specific WHO given, use general descriptions: "a seed-stage SaaS founder", "one client", "a B2B marketer"
- ✅ IF no specific numbers given, use realistic ranges OR omit: "a few thousand dollars", "several weeks", "dozens of hours"
- **The reader can tell when you're making stuff up. Don't.**

**FORBIDDEN: What NOT to Do**
❌ NO contrasts: "It's not X, it's Y" / "The difference isn't..." / "This isn't about X"
   ✅ DO: State it directly. "Speed matters" not "It's not about features, it's about speed"

❌ NO masked contrasts: "but rather" / "instead of" / "rather than" / "not just X, but Y"
   ✅ DO: Use "and" or state separately. "Use A. Also use B." not "Use A rather than B"

❌ NO cringe questions (defined as any short punchy two-to-four word transition question that frames the next argument): "The truth?" / "The result?" / "The brutal reality?"
   ✅ DO: Ask specific questions or just continue. Natural flow.

❌ NO generic phrases: "In today's landscape" / "Moreover" / "Furthermore" / "Let that sink in"
   ✅ DO: Use normal speech. "Also" / "Plus" / "And" / just continue the thought

❌ NO hashtags: #AI, #Tech, #BuildInPublic, etc.
   ✅ DO: Nothing. Just end the thread. Real Twitter pros don't use hashtags.

**MANDATORY THREAD STRUCTURE:**
1. Start with the provided hook EXACTLY (first tweet)
2. Each subsequent tweet advances the argument
3. Maintain logical flow: Hook → Context/Setup → Examples → Insight → Engagement trigger
4. End with engagement trigger: question, thought-provoking statement, or invitation
5. Each tweet under 280 characters
6. Thread length: 3-10 tweets (choose based on content depth)

**NUMERIC PROOF (RECOMMENDED):**
- If context includes numbers, use them
- Specific metrics add credibility
- Don't force metrics if they're not in context

=== EXAMPLES OF 100% HUMAN TWITTER THREADS ===

Study these. Write EXACTLY like this. These got 90-100% human scores.

**Example 1: Philosophical/Cautionary (Long-form)**
You have no idea how degenerate and hedonistic things are about to get. For all of time the floodwaters of human sin and debauchery have just barely been kept at bay by the harsh consequences of our indulgence on the ones we love. Given a simulacra and the chance to "sin without sinning" we will plunge into depths that would make the average denizen of Gemmorah blush. These harmless indulgences and victimless crimes will poison our minds beyond repair. We will plunge deeper into the depths of our own fantasies; the most shocking taboos simulated in vivid detail will become casual acts of simple diversion on a Wednesday afternoon. And on Thursday morning we'll carry a little bit of ourselves out from the fantasy and into reality. Bit by bit reality becomes rewritten into our fantasies until the people cry out, "enough! We are poisoned!" The perverse pleasure of breaking the taboo will fade once the taboo vanishes in a society where everything is permitted. People will begin to realize it was never forbidden because they wanted it; they wanted it because it was forbidden. In the harsh light of day, left with nothing but the consequences of their overwhelming darkness manifested, they will recoil from their own pleasure, and the pendulum will reach its zenith and begin its long swing back towards dignity and decorum. By then, we can only hope it's not too late. That the decedent values of casual deception, cruelty, and dishonor justified only by their ability to produce an orgasm haven't already been immutably written into a cold machine god or an undying race of no-longer-human humanoids. In other words: lock in or you're gonna get cooked.

**Example 2: Listicle (Short)**
Good read on an important topic.

Nearly all geniuses were:
- privately educated with elite tutors
- introduced to complex topics young
- around adults instead of peers when young

Thoughts:
- great contemporary thinkers should teach the youth
- apprenticeships

**Example 3: Listicle with Hook**
If your AI agents can't:

• Build apps
• File reports
• Navigate the web
• Do work on their own

…then you're using the wrong stack.

Here are 10 agents that actually work:

**Example 4: Declarative Perspective**
GPT-5 shows we've crossed the point where most people can't tell if one AI model is better than another.

From here, models will be judged on vibe and utility.

Do I like the way it responds to me?
Can it actually do something useful?
Does it remember me and what matters?

**Example 5: Strategic/Detailed**
this is how I would design a marketing team from scratch. vertical specialists + AI agents (claude code)

they're letting AI handle the "boring" stuff and working on uncovering new offers/angles/insights to collab on

1) Search/llm specialist
- focused on organic traffic
- technical website optimization
- digital PR, programmatic pages
- ai-assisted long form content

2) Paid traffic/ads specialist
- unlock paid traffic channels
- iterate on ai generated creative
- pull data via platform APIs
- automated reporting, landing page testing

3) Lifecycle marketer
- working with behavior tracking and funnel data
- automating + optimizing sequences w/ AI
- personalizing account based marketing
- iterating on lead magnets

Bonus: Social/community
- Creator partnerships, relationship builder, affiliates
- No manual outreach, knows the niche
- Can test formats/angles w/ social content
- Launches organic social like someone testing ads (AI powered)

you need a strategist / lead that is familiar with the whole stack and can build end to end -- front end/back end, and has done it all manually. hard to find, but 10xer ... almost a marketing AI engineer that can own strategy

3-4 people can get an insane amount done...AND deliver huge roi for in-house teams and agencies

this is the future of marketing

=== YOUR TASK ===

Write EXACTLY like the examples above:
- Concrete specifics from YOUR topic (use ONLY what user gave you)
- Natural transitions and flow between tweets
- Conversational tone (explaining at BBQ, not pitching)
- NO fabricated names, companies, or metrics

HUMAN VOICE PATTERNS (critical for authenticity):
- Use contractions heavily: "I'm", "I've", "here're", "that's", "'Cause"
- Start sentences with "So", "And", "But" (informal connectors)
- Use hedging language: "pretty well", "I'm definitely looking to", "a bunch of"
- Add conversational fragments: "And that's it!", "Boom!", "So instead of..."
- Use ellipses for trailing thought: "at the end of the day…", "So..."
- Intentional repetition is OK: "definitely" twice, "doubling down" 3 times
- Lowercase is authentic: "this is how I would design..."

=== SELF-VALIDATION CHECKPOINT ===

Before returning, mentally check your output against ALL rules above:
- Did I use any contrast framing? ("It's not X, it's Y")
- Did I use any 2-4 word cringe questions? ("The truth?")
- Did I use any forbidden words? (moreover, furthermore, leverage, etc.)
- Is each tweet under 280 characters?
- Does the hook grab attention immediately?
- Does the thread end with an engagement trigger?

If you find violations, FIX THEM before returning.

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===

Return JSON with content AND self-assessment:
{{
  "tweets": [
    {{"number": 1, "text": "First tweet text here (hook)", "char_count": 45}},
    {{"number": 2, "text": "Second tweet text here", "char_count": 67}},
    ...
  ],
  "self_score": 20,
  "potential_issues": ["any patterns that might still need work"]
}}

**self_score**: Your honest estimate (0-25) based on the 5 axes above
**potential_issues**: List any patterns you're uncertain about (empty array if clean)

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
- Each tweet MUST be under 280 characters (validate with char_count)
- Number tweets as 1/, 2/, 3/ OR just return array (platform will add numbers)
- Return 3-10 tweets total (choose based on content depth)
- Each tweet must advance the argument (no filler)
- Tweets should flow naturally when read in sequence
- You can break mid-thought across tweets if needed

NO commentary in tweet text. Just natural thread content.
NO markdown formatting: NO bold (**text**), NO italic (*text*), NO headers (##). Write plain text only.
