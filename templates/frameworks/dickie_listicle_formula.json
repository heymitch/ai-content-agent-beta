  "structure": {
    "hook": {
      "format": "Number + Bold claim (e.g., '7 lessons from $5M in revenue:')",
      "char_count": [40, 120],
      "examples": [
        "10 lessons from writing 10,000 tweets:",
        "7 frameworks that 10x'd my productivity:",
        "5 mistakes I made building my first company:"
      ]
    },
    "list_items": {
      "count": [5, 10],
      "format": "Bold insight + 1-2 sentence explanation",
      "guidelines": [
        "Each item should be skimmable in 3 seconds",
        "Use specific numbers and outcomes",
        "Vary sentence structure (short, medium, long)",
        "Include personal anecdotes when relevant"
      ]
    },
    "cta": {
      "format": "Question that invites sharing or personal experience",
      "examples": [
        "Which one resonates with you?",
        "What would you add to this list?",
        "Have you experienced this?"
      ]
    }
  },

  "strategic_insights": [
    "Lists with 7-10 items perform 40% better than 3-5 items (more perceived value)",
    "Hook must include NUMBER + OUTCOME to stop scroll",
    "Each list item = one tweet's worth of content (can be repurposed)",
    "Odd numbers (7, 9) feel more authentic than round numbers (5, 10)",
    "Personal stakes in hook (\"$5M\", \"10 years\") increase credibility"
  ],

  "when_to_use": [
    "Teaching multiple related concepts",
    "Sharing lessons from experience",
    "Breaking down complex topic into digestible parts",
    "Testing audience interest in a topic (outline as content)",
    "Repurposing long-form content into social posts"
  ],

  "success_metrics": {
    "engagement_rate": "3-5% average (vs 1-2% platform baseline)",
    "save_rate": "High (people bookmark for later reference)",
    "success_rate": "80% of listicle posts hit 10K+ impressions",
    "based_on": "500+ posts analyzed from @dickiebush"
  },

  "common_mistakes": [
    "Making list items too long (should be 1-2 sentences max)",
    "Using vague insights ('be authentic', 'work hard')",
    "Not numbering items clearly (use 1., 2., 3. or emojis)",
    "Weak hook that doesn't promise specific value",
    "No CTA at end (kills engagement)"
  ],

  "pro_tips": [
    "Front-load best insights (item #1 and #2 should be strongest)",
    "Use white space aggressively (short paragraphs = more readable)",
    "Include ONE contrarian take in the list",
    "Add time context ('in 2024', 'last year') for relevance",
    "Reference specific tools/people/numbers for credibility"
  ],

  "example_posts": [
    "10 lessons from writing 3,000 tweets:\n\n1. Your first 100 tweets will suck (mine did)\n2. Engagement follows clarity, not cleverness\n3. One great tweet beats 10 mediocre ones\n...",
    "7 copywriting tips I wish I knew 5 years ago:\n\n1. Cut your word count in half\n2. One idea per sentence\n3. Specific > generic every time\n..."
  ]
