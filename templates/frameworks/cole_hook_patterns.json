  "hook_principles": [
    "Specificity beats vagueness (use numbers, names, timef rames)",
    "Stakes matter (money, time, reputation)",
    "Curiosity gap (tease what's coming without giving it away)",
    "First 8 words determine if people keep reading",
    "Personal > theoretical (your story > general advice)"
  ],

  "strategic_insights": [
    "Bold Outcome Hooks work best on LinkedIn (professional results)",
    "Contrarian Questions perform well on Twitter (debate culture)",
    "Specific Number Hooks are universal (concrete = credible)",
    "Mistake Admission builds trust faster than success stories",
    "Pattern Interrupt positions you as thought leader",
    "First sentence should be <15 words for mobile readability",

  "testing_framework": {
    "step_1": "Write 3 variations of your hook using different patterns",
    "step_2": "Pick the one with most specificity + stakes",
    "step_3": "Cut it down by 30% (remove fluff)",
    "step_4": "Read it out loud (if it sounds unnatural, rewrite)",
    "step_5": "Check: Does it create curiosity without clickbait?"
  },

  "common_mistakes": [
    "Making hook too long (>20 words)",
    "Being vague ('I learned something important about business')",
    "No stakes ('I tried a thing and it worked okay')",
    "Giving away the punchline in the hook",
    "Using jargon or corporate speak"
  ],

  "pro_tips": [
    "Use power words: 'killed', 'destroyed', '10x'd', 'obliterated'",
    "Add time pressure: 'in 30 days', 'overnight', 'by next week'",
    "Include a number: '7 ways', '$100K', '3 mistakes'",
    "Name drop when relevant: 'Stripe uses this', 'from Y Combinator'",
    "Break grammar rules if it sounds better"
