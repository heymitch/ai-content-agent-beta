    "Most founders focus on growth. Smart ones focus on retention.\n\nGrowth people obsess over acquisition cost, ad spend, viral loops. They celebrate hitting 10K users while ignoring that 80% churned in month one.\n\nRetention people do the opposite. They study why the 20% stayed, then double down on that. Because they know: 100 users who stick around beat 10,000 who bounce.\n\nI learned this after burning $50K on ads that brought 5,000 signups. 94% churned. Felt like a genius until I looked at retention.\n\nThe real difference? Growth is a vanity metric until retention proves you built something people actually want.\n\nWhat's your experience been?"
